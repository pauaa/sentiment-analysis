## Supervised sentiment analysis on tweet data

Short example how to train C-Support Vector Classifier to classify tweets into negative and positive classes.

The best classifier and the parameters were found using GridSearchCV. Accuracy and F-score were used to measure how good the classifier is.

The data used to train and test the classifier is not public and thus not included in the respository.
